##  Description

This project is a full-stack application built with a **Node.js** and **Express** back-end and a simple HTML/CSS/JS front-end. It takes a user's simple context or idea and uses the **Google Gemini API** to generate a detailed, high-quality prompt. The core logic is powered by a "meta-prompt" that instructs the AI to act as an expert prompt engineer, following a structured framework (Task, Context, References) to produce creative and effective results.

##  Features

-   **Simple & Intuitive UI:** A clean interface for users to input their ideas.
-   **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Utilizes a sophisticated meta-prompt to generate high-quality, structured prompts.
-   **Creative Expansion:** The AI is instructed to creatively add detail and suggest angles, not just reformat the user's input.
-   **Plain Text Output:** The final prompt is cleaned of any markdown formatting for easy copying and pasting.
-   **Secure API Key Handling:** Uses `dotenv` to keep the Google Gemini API key secure and out of the codebase.
